        <p> Besides the <em>while </em>statement just introduced, Python uses the usual flow control statements known from other languages, with some twists.</p>
      <article id="if_Statements">
        <h2>if Statements</h2>
           <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the <em>if</em> statement. For example:</p>
           <code>
              >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
              Please enter an integer: 42
              >>> if x < 0:
             ...     x = 0
             ...     print('Negative changed to zero')
             ... elif x == 0:
             ...     print('Zero')
             ... elif x == 1:
             ...     print('Single')
             ... else:
             ...  print('More')
             ...
             More
             ...
            </code>
          <p>
            There can be zero or more <em>elif </em> parts, and the <em>else </em> part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.
         </p>

      <article id="for_Statements">
        <h2>for Statements</h2>
          <p> The <em>for</em> statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):</p>
          <code> 
             >>> # Measure some strings:
             ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
             >>> for w in words:
             ...     print(w, len(w))
             ...
             cat 3
             window 6
             defenestrate 12
          </code>
          <p> Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:</p>
          <code>
            # Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
            for user, status in users.copy().items():
            if status == 'inactive':
            del users[user]
    
            # Strategy:  Create a new collection
            active_users = {}
            for user, status in users.items():
            if status == 'active':
            active_users[user] = status
          </code>
       </article>
     <article id="The_range()_Function">
        <h2>The range() Function</h2>
         <p> If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function <em>range()</em> comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions: </p>
         <code> >>> for i in range(5):
          ...     print(i)
          ...
          0
          1
          2
          3
          4
         </code>
         <p>
           The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):
         </p>
         <code>
           range(5, 10)
           5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    
           range(0, 10, 3)
           0, 3, 6, 9
    
           range(-10, -100, -30)
          -10, -40, -70
         </code>
           <p>
            To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and len() as follows:
           </p>
         <code>
           >>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
           >>> for i in range(len(a)):
           ...  print(i, a[i])
           ...
           0 Mary
           1 had
           2 a
           3 little
           4 lamb
         </code>
         <p>
           In most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the enumerate() function, see Looping Techniques.
           A strange thing happens if you just print a range:
         </p>
         <code>
           >>> print(range(10))
           range(0, 10)
         </code>
         <p>
           In many ways the object returned by range() behaves as if it is a list, but in fact it isn’t. It is an object which returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn’t really make the list, thus saving space.
         </p>
         <p>
           We say such an object is iterable, that is, suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect something from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. We have seen that the for statement is such a construct, while an example of a function that takes an iterable is sum():
         </p>
         <code>
           >>> sum(range(4))  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 
            6
         </code>
         <p>
           Later we will see more functions that return iterables and take iterables as arguments. Lastly, maybe you are curious about how to get a list from a range. Here is the solution:
         </p>
         <code>
           >>> list(range(4))
           [0, 1, 2, 3]
         </code>
         <p>
           In chapter <em>Data Structures</em>, we will discuss in more detail about <em>list()</em>
         </p>

       <article id="break_and_continue,_and_else_Clauses_on_Loops">
         <h2>break and continue, and else Clauses on Loops</h2>
         
           <p> The<em> break</em> statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing <em>for</em> or <em>while</em> loop.
            Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the iterable (with <em>for</em>) or when the condition becomes false (with <em>while</em>), but not when the loop is terminated by a <em>break</em> statement. This is exemplified by the following loop, which searches for prime numbers:
          </P>
         <code> 
           >>> for n in range(2, 10):
           ...     for x in range(2, n):
           ...         if n % x == 0:
           ...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
           ...             break
           ...     else:
           ...         # loop fell through without finding a factor
           ...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
           ...
           2 is a prime number
           3 is a prime number
           4 equals 2 * 2
           5 is a prime number
           6 equals 2 * 3
           7 is a prime number
           8 equals 2 * 4
           9 equals 3 * 3
         </code>
         <p> (Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the <em>else</em> clause belongs to the <em>for</em> loop, not the if statement.)</p>
         <p>When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a <em>try</em> statement than it does with that of <em>if</em> statements: a <em>try </em>statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs. For more on the try statement and exceptions, see <em>Handling Exceptions</em>. </p>
         <p>The <em>continue</em> statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop: </p>
         <code>
           >>> for num in range(2, 10):
           ...     if num % 2 == 0:
           ...         print("Found an even number", num)
           ...         continue
           ...     print("Found an odd number", num)
           Found an even number 2
           Found an odd number 3
           Found an even number 4
           Found an odd number 5
           Found an even number 6
           Found an odd number 7
           Found an even number 8
           Found an odd number 9

      <article id="pass_Statements">
        <h2>pass Statements</h2>
          <p>The <em>pass</em> statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. For example: </p>
          <code>
            >>> while True:
            ...     pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
            ...
          </code>
          <p> This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:</p>
          <code>
           >>> class MyEmptyClass:
           ...     pass
           ...  
          </code>
          <p>  Another place <em>pass</em> can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:</p>
          <code>
            >>> def initlog(*args):
            ...     pass   # Remember to implement this!
            ...

      <article id="Defining_Functions">
        <h2>Defining Functions</h2>
          <p> We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:</p>
          <code>
            >>> def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
            ...     """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""
            ...     a, b = 0, 1
            ...     while a < n:
            ...         print(a, end=' ')
            ...         a, b = b, a+b
            ...     print()
            ...
             >>> # Now call the function we just defined:
            ... fib(2000)
           0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597
          </code>
           <ul>
             <li> <p> The keyword <em>def</em> introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.</p> </li>
             <li> <p> The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s documentation string, or docstring. (More about docstrings can be found in the section <em>Documentation Strings</em>.) There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.</p></li>
             <li> <p>The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for <em>global</em> variables, named in a global statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions, named in a <em>nonlocal</em> statement), although they may be referenced. </p></li>
             <li> <p>The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object). 1 When a function calls another function, or calls itself recursively, a new local symbol table is created for that call. </p></li>
             <li><p>A function definition associates the function name with the function object in the current symbol table. The interpreter recognizes the object pointed to by that name as a user-defined function. Other names can also point to that same function object and can also be used to access the function: </p></li>
           </ul>
            <code>
              >>> fib
              <function fib at 10042ed0>
              >>> f = fib
              >>> f(100)
              0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
            </code>
            <p>
              Coming from other languages, you might object that fib is not a function but a procedure since it doesn’t return a value. In fact, even functions without a <em>return</em>statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None (it’s a built-in name). Writing the value None is normally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using <em>print()</em>:</p>
              <code>
                >>> fib(0)
                >>> print(fib(0))
                None
              </code>
              <p>
                It is simple to write a function that returns a list of the numbers of the Fibonacci series, instead of printing it:
              </P>
            <code>
              >>> def fib2(n):  # return Fibonacci series up to n
              ...     """Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n."""
              ...     result = []
              ...     a, b = 0, 1
              ...     while a < n:
              ...         result.append(a)    # see below
              ...         a, b = b, a+b
              ...     return result
              ...
              >>> f100 = fib2(100)    # call it
              >>> f100                # write the result
              [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
            </code>
              <p>This example, as usual, demonstrates some new Python features:</p>
              <p> 
               <ul> 
                 <li>The <em>return</em> statement returns with a value from a function. return without an expression argument returns None. Falling off the end of a function also returns None. </li>
                 <li> The statement result.append(a) calls a method of the list object result. A method is a function that ‘belongs’ to an object and is named obj.methodname, where obj is some object (this may be an expression), and methodname is the name of a method that is defined by the object’s type. Different types define different methods. Methods of different types may have the same name without causing ambiguity. (It is possible to define your own object types and methods, using classes, see <em>Classes</em>) The method append() shown in the example is defined for list objects; it adds a new element at the end of the list. In this example it is equivalent to <int>result = result + [a],</int> but more efficient.</li>
